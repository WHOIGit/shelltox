# Shellfish Toxicity Modeling
Red tide is a type of harmful algae bloom that affects human and wild marine activities.
This project seeks to correlate the cell count concentration of *Alexandrium Catenella* (red tide) with toxins (Saxitoxin hydrochloride) in Blue Mussels (*Mytilus edulis*) off the coast of Maine.
